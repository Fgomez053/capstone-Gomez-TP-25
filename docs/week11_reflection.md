WEEK 11 REFLECTION

Key Takeaways

The Capstone goals are set to make sure we know how to integrate API data with a local historical databases and its the capsones goal to a user-friendly GUI


Conecept Connection
i feel like im strongest with python and tkinter. And i know i need more practice with machine learning. Machine learning seemed to be the hardest concept to grasp so far.

Early challenges
so far ive been trying work on how my data is interpreted. when i type the city the results i get back are pretty dull. so ive been trying to figure that out.

Support Strategy 
office hours works the best for me.even though its kinda first come first serve.

SECTION 2

feature 1 - 1 Star-Canvas-based weather representations. i want to make my app look nice. im not to big on how things look but im hoping to at least learn what would make sense to the eye. 

feature 2 -2 Stars- theme switcher. Im always in dark mode and feel its a necessary button. one of the reasons i chose this feature.

feature 3 -  3 Stars - activity suggester weather-based recomendations- I chose this one because it seems like its going to be a challenge.

 - canvas weather images might cause small set backs if i dont make an account soon


SECTION 7 support

 i would love to have more one on one with instructors who want to be there during office hours. i understand some indtuctors dont wanna be there and thats fine but maybe you can open up breakout rooms for students to help eachother.
